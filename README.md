# Flycast Memory Engine

A RAM search program designed to search, track, and edit the emulated memory of [the Flycast emulator](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin) during runtime. The primary goal is to make research, tool-assisted speedruns, and reverse engineering of Dreamcast games more convenient and easier than with the alternative solution, Cheat Engine. The program's name is derived from Dolphin Memory Engine as a nod to its roots.

The GUI is aimed for convenience, without disrupting the performance of the emulation. Qt 6 is used to help accomplish this.

## System requirements
Any x86_64 based system should work. Though at the moment Windows is the most reliable build

This repository uses CMake for all platforms.

At least 250 MB of free memory is required.

You need to have Flycast running ***and*** _have the emulation started_ for this program to be useful. As such, the system must be able to run Flycast.

On Linux and macOS, installation of the Qt 6 package(s) is required.

## Portable Configuration
By default, the program will store configuration in your User Configuration folder.

Windows: `%AppData%\dolphin-memory-engine`

Linux/macOS: `~/.config/dolphin-memory-engine`

Create a empty file `portable.txt` in the same directory as Dolphin Memory Engine and the configuration will instead be saved in the same folder as the program.

## How to Build

### Microsoft Windows
Visual Studio 2022 and later is recommended. The Windows SDK Version 10.0.22621.0 is required.

The Windows SDK version 10.0.22621.0 comes with the C++ Desktop Development Workload of Visual Studio 2022 â€” other versions may work but are untested.

Before proceeding, ensure the Qt submodule is initialized by running `git submodule update --init` at the repository's root. The files should appear at the `Externals\Qt` directory.

Once complete, open the `Source` directory with Visual Studio's `Open a local folder` option.

### Linux - Not currently supported
> _CMake and Qt 6 are required. Please refer to your distribution's documentation for specific instructions on how to install them._

### MacOS - Not currently supported
Xcode, Qt 6, and CMake are required. These can be installed through `xcode-select --install`, `brew install qt@6`, and `brew install cmake` (you may need to install [brew](https://brew.sh) first). Ensure that Qt is symlinked into a place that CMake can find it or added to `$PATH`. With brew, you can run `export PATH="$(brew --prefix qt@6):$PATH"` before compiling. **After compilation, continue to [macOS code signing](#macos-code-signing).**

To build, simply run the following commands from the `Source` directory:

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make

The compiled binaries should be appear in the directory named `build`.

## MacOS code signing - also currently not supported
Due to security hardening on recent versions of macOS, the Dolphin Emulator executable must be signed with a valid certificate and entitlements so that it can be debugged. First, [create a code signing certificate](https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/PermissionsDarwin):

> Start Keychain Access application (/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app)
>
> Open the menu item /Keychain Access/Certificate Assistant/Create a Certificate...
>
> Choose a name (gdb-cert in the example), set Identity Type to Self Signed Root, set Certificate Type to Code Signing and select the Let me override defaults. Click several times on Continue until you get to the Specify a Location For The Certificate screen, then set Keychain to System.

Then, run the interactive `MacSetup.sh` script inside the `Tools` directory (if built from source) or included in the build archive to re-sign Dolphin Emulator:

    sh ./MacSetup.sh

**Note that Flycast must also be re-signed using this script after an update.**

## General usage
Open Flycast and start a game, then run this program.

If the hooking process is successful, the UI should be enabled, otherwise, click the hook button.

Once hooked, scans can be performed just like Cheat Engine as well as management of a watch list. Save and load a watch list to the disk by using the file menu. The watch list files are in JSON and can be edited in any text editor.

If the program unhooks itself from Flycast, a read/write operation has failed. This is likely caused by the emulation halting. Boot a game again to solve this; the watch list and scan will be retained during the unhooking.

Finally, the program includes a memory viewer which shows a hexadecimal view and an ASCII view of the memory. Click on the corresponding button or right click on a watch to browse the memory using the memory viewer.

## Troubleshooting

### Development
 - currently Linux and MacOs are not supported, so use at your own risk. Maybe they will be supported in the future.

### Linux

1. This program requires additional kernel permissions to be able to read and write memory to external processes (which is required to read and write the memory of Dolphin). If the program frequently unhooks itself, the program is missing the required permissions. Grant these permissions with:

`sudo setcap cap_sys_ptrace=eip flycast-memory-engine`

where `dolphin-memory-engine` is the path of the Dolphin Memory Engine executable. This sets the permission for future executions. If it doesn't work, verify that you do not have the `nosuid` mount flag on your `/etc/fstab` as it can cause this command to silently fail.

2. Some setups may require running as root, ex:

`sudo -E ./dolphin-memory-engine-linux-x86_64.AppImage`

If you're on wayland, you may also need to allow root to access xwayland

`xhost si:localuser:root`

### MacOS

Dolphin (upon install or after an update) must be signed with specific entitlements to permit memory access. Follow the instructions [above](#macos-code-signing).

## Special Notes
This program could not have happened without the immense development work of the base program - Dolphin Memory Engine. Literally all that was done for this is to replace the internals to work with a different emulator.
